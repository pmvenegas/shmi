shmi - ssh, more info

shmi is a wrapper for ssh and screen which maintains a side channel
and polls for information about your login and the remote machine,
shows it as a screen title or status on your local screen
window.

For convenience, key-based (passwordless) ssh is assumed.

Customize to fit.

TODO
  - reset original title and hstatus cleanly
  - look into integration with byobu or similar

Warning: shmi is a bad hack I wrote for my own use, but some guys
thought it was useful so I put it up. Mileage may vary.
